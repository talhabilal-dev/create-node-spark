## [2.5.0] - 2025-08-1 to 2025-08-14

### Added

- **Package Manager Selection**: Users can now choose between npm and pnpm during project initialization
- **Directory Existence Check**: Automatically checks if project directory already exists before creation to prevent overwrites

### Changed

- **Dependency Installation**: All package installations now respect the user's chosen package manager (npm or pnpm)
- **Script Generation**: Generated package.json scripts now use the appropriate package manager commands
- **Setup Tasks**: All setup tasks (ESLint, Multer, Database) now use the selected package manager consistently

## [2.4.1] - 2025-08-13

### Added

- **Developer-Friendly ESLint Configuration**: Balanced ESLint setup for solo developers and small teams
- **TypeScript-Specific Linting**: Added `typescript-eslint` with reasonable type safety rules
- **Code Quality Rules**: Essential rules for code consistency without being overwhelming
- **Prettier Integration**: Added `.prettierrc` configuration for consistent code formatting
- **Multiple Lint Scripts**: Added `lint`, `lint:fix`, `lint:check`, `format`, and `format:check` npm scripts
- **Smart Ignore Patterns**: Created comprehensive `.eslintignore` file excluding build outputs, dependencies, and IDE files
- **Test File Configuration**: Special ESLint rules for test files with relaxed restrictions

### Changed

- **From Strict to Practical** ‚Äì Started with strict rules, then softened them for better DX while keeping quality safeguards.
- **TypeScript Support Upgrade** ‚Äì Moved from JS-only linting to full TypeScript linting with type information.
- **Relaxed `any` Usage** ‚Äì Now warns instead of errors on `any` for early development flexibility.

- **Promise Rules Adjusted** ‚Äì Loosened some async handling rules for real-world workflows.

## Fixed

- **Type-Aware ESLint Errors** ‚Äì Resolved parser issues so ESLint understands TypeScript syntax and types.
- **File Targeting** ‚Äì Lint commands now focus on `src/` and skip compiled output (`dist/`).
- **Plugin Compatibility** ‚Äì Fixed conflicts between ESLint core, TypeScript ESLint plugin, and Node/Promise plugins.
